I Wanna Be The Bachelor is a [fangame](http://fangam.es/) to [I Wanna Be The Guy](http://iwbtg.kayin.moe/). Instead of using one of the several GameMaker Engines provided by the community, I made my own little “engine”, building on the Quintus JavaScript HTML5 Game Engine and using Tiled Map Editor. It features 30 levels, including 2 original bosses and tons of deaths.

To play the game simply run index.html in your browser. Alternatively you can watch me play it in my [personal playthrough](https://youtu.be/ojSJBb3fBak).

I do not claim any copyright for the songs used in this game. The original sources are found in the credits file.
